# To to list for Rahbani's structures

- [x] Copy the structure names, SMILES, charges to excel
- [x] Obtain SMILES structure of deprotonated forms (be careful with anion charges)
- [x] Crest calculations on Fe(III) and ligand
  - [x] Alternatively, we know where the bonds will happen, just build them? depends on how quick crest is
- [x] Generate ML3 structures
- [x] Perform xTB to get approximate structure - skipped
- [x] DFT minimal basis set to get a better structure
  - [x] Low spin only? no doing low and high spin
- [x] Add solvation shells, calculate single points, 
- [x] redox potentials
- [ ] fix redox potentials â€“ issue with number of waters
- [ ] Run with constrained xtb, freeze the molecule and optimize waters, get redox potentials
