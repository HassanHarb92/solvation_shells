# To to list for Rahbani's structures

- [x] Copy the structure names, SMILES, charges to excel
- [x] Obtain SMILES structure of deprotonated forms (be careful with anion charges)
- [x] Crest calculations on Fe(III) and ligand
  - [x] Alternatively, we know where the bonds will happen, just build them? depends on how quick crest is
- [x] Generate ML3 structures
- [ ] Perform xTB to get approximate structure
- [ ] DFT minimal basis set to get a better structure
  - [ ] Low spin only?
- [ ] Add solvation shells, calculate single points, redox potentials
